// Sams house has an apple tree and an orange tree that yield an abundance of fruit. 
// using the information below determine the number of apples and oranges that land on sams house 

// the red region denotes the house, and s is the start point and t is the endpoint. the apple tree is to the left of the house and the orange tree is to the right
// assume the tree are located on a single point,where the apple tree is at point a and the orange tree is at point b

// when a fruit falls from a tree it lands d units of distance along the x axis a negative value of d mean that the fruit fell d units to the trees left and a positive 
// value of d means that the fruit fell d units to the right. 

// given the d value of m apples and n oranges determine how many apples and oranges will fall on sams house(i.e the inclusive range of [s,t])
